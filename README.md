# What To Do With This Template

## As a Problemsetter

To tell the tester which files it should use for each test case, change the arrays "inputFiles" and "expectedOutputFiles" so that it contains the right files.

## As a Solver

First write your solution in Main.java. 

When you are done, compile both Main.java and Tester.java. 

If you are using BlueJ, hit the compile button.

If you are using another program, you probably know what to do.

If you want to compile from the terminal, navigate to the right folder and use
```
javac Main.java Tester.java
```

After you finish compiling, run Tester.

If you are using BlueJ, run Tester.main() with no arguments as so:
```
Tester.main({});
```

If you are using another program, you (again) probably already know what to do.

Finally, if you want to run from the terminal, use
```
java Tester
```
